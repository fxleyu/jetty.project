=== Upgrading from Jetty 9.x to Jetty 10.0.x

The purpose of this guide is to assist users migrating from Jetty 9 to 10.
It is not comprehensive, but covers many of the major changes included in the release that may prove as problem areas for users.

//TODO - Make note of any specific required Java versions.

==== Changes to Websocket

==== `javax.mail` and `javax.transaction`

Both `javax.mail` and `javax.transaction` have been removed from the Jetty Distribution in Jetty 10.
If you require these jars, you will need to enable the `ext` link:#startup-modules[module] and copy the files to your `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext` directory.

==== Removed Classes

//TODO - Insert major removed/refactored classes from Jetty-9.x.x to Jetty-10.0.x
